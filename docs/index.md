### App Developer

`Mar 2016 - Dec 2020`

I made an app and put it on the Google app store. I made a little bit of money so I am counting it as a job. The skills/tactics I used to make this app were:

- Java for the backend and XML for the user interface.
- Google for learning how to make and then publish an app.
- Git for version control


### Tutor - Tutoring Club

`Jul 2021 - Dec 2021`

I was a tutor to students ages 8 to 18 and taught math, science, English, and computer coding. My responsibilities included:

- Provided private instruction to individual and/or small groups of students to improve academic performance.
- Provided feedback to students using positive reinforcement techniques to encourage, motivate, and build confidence.
- Fostered meaningful relationships among students through teamwork projects.
